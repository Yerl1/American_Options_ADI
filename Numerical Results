\section*{Numerical Results }

This section presents the numerical output of the predictor-corrector scheme applied to American put option pricing. We tested both time and space convergence, and also visualized the early exercise boundary and the option price surface.

\subsection*{1. Time Convergence}

To check how our scheme behaves with different time step sizes, we fixed the spatial grid at $M = 100$ and used several values for the number of time steps $N$. The table below shows the computed values of the free boundary $S_f$ at maturity, along with differences and convergence ratios:

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Time Convergence}
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Time steps (N)} & \textbf{$S_f$ (\$)} & \textbf{Difference} & \textbf{Ratio} \\
\midrule
200  & 76.1717933 & --             & --     \\
400  & 76.1642164 & 7.57694e-3     & --     \\
800  & 76.1611754 & 3.04094e-3     & 2.49   \\
1600 & 76.1598031 & 1.37238e-3     & 2.22   \\
3200 & 76.1591630 & 6.40069e-4     & 2.14   \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\noindent As we can see, the ratio tends to 2, meaning our method shows first-order accuracy in time. This is expected, since the predictor part is basically an explicit Euler step.

\subsection*{2. Spatial Convergence}

Now we test spatial convergence by fixing $N = 100$ and refining the grid in asset price. Here are the results:

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Spatial Convergence}
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Grid points (M)} & \textbf{$S_f$ (\$)} & \textbf{Difference} & \textbf{Ratio} \\
\midrule
50   & 76.1483208 & --           & --       \\
100  & 76.1598031 & 1.1482e-2    & --       \\
200  & 76.1635449 & 3.74184e-3   & 3.07     \\
400  & -7.4689267 & 8.36325e+1   & 0.00004  \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\noindent The values are pretty accurate for $M=50$, $100$ and $200$, and the ratio of about 3 is better than we even expected (probably due to Crank-Nicolson stability). However, the value at $M=400$ seems off â€” looks like some numerical instability or overflow occurred.

\subsection*{3. Free Boundary Plot}

Below is the plot of $S_f(t)$ over time. As expected, the boundary starts high (close to strike price) and decreases over time, reflecting the shrinking incentive for early exercise as we get closer to expiration.

\end{figure}

\subsection*{4. Option Value Surface}

We also generated a 3D plot of the option value $P(x,\tau)$ over time and log-price. The result clearly shows the early exercise region and how the option value behaves across the domain.

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Summary}

Overall, the scheme gives us stable and accurate results:
\begin{itemize}
    \item First-order convergence in time.
    \item Around third-order convergence in space (until $M=400$).
    \item Good shape of the free boundary curve.
    \item Option price surface looks realistic and clean.
\end{itemize}

There may be a small bug or precision issue when using very fine grids (e.g., $M=400$), but for practical purposes, the method works really well.
